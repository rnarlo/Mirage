	<p>
		Very much inspired by <a href="https://receiptify.herokuapp.com">Receiptify</a>, this
		application is for displaying your top Spotify tracks/artists in a creative manner. It also
		takes inspiration from Spotify Wrapped.
	</p>
	<p>
		This app makes use of Spotify's Web API, hence the options' being limited. Mirage unfortunately
		cannot show you your top tracks from a more specific timeframe. :(
	</p>
	<p style="font-weight: bold; color: var(--persian-green);">
		This application is in no way affiliated or in partnership with Spotify.
	</p>
	<p>Currently under construction!</p>
